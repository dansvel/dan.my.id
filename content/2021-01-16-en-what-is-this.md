Hello, my name is **Dan**. I'm a demihuman who learns this and that in this long journey of life.

Usually, I delve into understanding both humanity and technology. And I entertain myself by consuming novels, comics, or films.

On this blog, I will share the knowledge I acquire or things that catch my interest. Currently, the focus is more on the world of web and JavaScript.

## Contact

Apart from this blog, you can find me as **@dansvel** in the virtual world. I often share on English-language platforms like [dev.to](https://dev.to/dansvel) or through fun projects on [Github](https://github.com/dansvel).

If you wish to get in touch, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dansvel) is the most responsive channel.

That's all for now.
