Happy New Year! ðŸŽ‰

Life often brings unexpected surprises. Last year, I was genuinely shocked by all the work-related matters, leaving me speechless.

## Genesis of This Blog

This is not the first blog I've created. I've tried making blogs, writing, stopping, creating again, and writing again. They all ended up neglected due to my carelessness.

Writing, in essence, greatly aids my memory. However, at times, laziness overtakes me, and things are forgotten. I tried writing everywhere, from notebooks to checklists, even digital notes.

## Re-Solution: Tackling the Same Issue

When faced with the habit of procrastination, the solution is quite simple: just do it! Unintentionally, I reopened this blog after a year and a half, reigniting the desire to write. Starting with revamping the blog's appearance, I hope to bring a fresh vibe that motivates writing.

## Ingredients of This Blog

Initially just a whim, my focus shifted from writing to learning how static blogs function. I spent time creating it and then tweaking it under the guise of perfecting it. With Sveltekit as the framework, DaisyUI for layout, Gicus as the forum, and Cloudflare as its engine.

## About This Blog

This blog will contain anything I learn or find intriguing. Currently, my pleasure lies in casually coding, particularly in the realms of web and JavaScript. I will also share how I research and delve into the essence of humanity.

## Hopes

This year, I have a new determination. I want to be more diligent in writing and sharing stories, knowledge, and experiences. May we always be blessed and provided with grace, living each day with gratitude and the spirit to continually evolve into the best version of ourselves.

I hope this year will be filled with achievements and happiness. Enjoy reading, and let's embark on this adventure together in 2024! ðŸš€
